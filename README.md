# Shader Graph Procedural Targets
Shader Graph custom targets supporting procedural instancing.

## Problem Statement
### Procedural Instancing
Requires Custom Function Nodes for injecting pragmas and include custom HLSL file.

## Solution Prototype
### Procedural Setup in Graph Settings
The custom target(s) feature additional settings for procedural setup.

- Procedural Instancing (bool): adds the required pragmas to the shader.
- Procedural Include File (ShaderInclude): the HLSL file to be included. This file must either contain, directly or through includes, the ProceduralFunction.
(e.g.:"Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal/ShaderLibrary/ParticlesInstancing.hlsl)
- Procedural Function Name (string): the name of the function to be used for procedural setup.
(e.g.:"ParticleInstancingSetup")
